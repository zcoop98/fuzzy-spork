# fuzzy-spork README!
This is where I'll keep track of all steps taken to make my project, including useful links and tidbits of info that I've found handy 
## Steps
1. Create repo in github, make sure "Initialize this repository with a README" checkbox is checked!
2. Clone repo to local using *Clone or download* button on github
* Use ssh link, add new ssh key if necessary (refer to ssh links below)
3. Open command prompt, navigate to local repository
4. Execute `npx create-react-app <APP-NAME>`
5. Execute `cd <APP-NAME>`
6. Execute `yarn start`
* The default web browser will open a new instance to `http://localhost:3000/`, and should display a large, slowly spinning React logo with the text "Edit src/App.js and save to reload." underneath, and a link to [Learn React](https://reactjs.org/)
